# Examples

Welcome to the **Examples** section of our documentation! ðŸŽ‰

The COOM Suite contains a range of (product) configuration examples encoded in
the [COOM language][coom]. They can be found in the [Examples folder][examples-coom].

For illustration of the different COOM language fragments,
we have various examples of bike configurations in increasing complexity:

- [Kids Bike][kids]
- [City Bike][city]
- [Travel Bike][travel]
- [Cargo Bike][cargo]

We also provide the corresponding [ASP facts][examples-asp] to these examples.

## How to Use This Section

Each example includes:

1. **Instructions** to run the example.
1. **Code snippets** to demonstrate implementation.
1. **Helpful visuals** to illustrate key concepts.
