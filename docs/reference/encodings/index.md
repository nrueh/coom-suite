# Encodings

In this section we show a basic documentation of our encoding in the form of a docstring of the used predicates.

??? info "clindoc"

    In the future we we would like to show here
    an automatic documentation of our encodings using clindoc (under development).


```prolog
--8<-- "src/coomsuite/encodings/doc.lp"
```
