# ASP translations of examples

This directory contains some of the ASP translations of the COOM product
configuration models.

- The files with the `-coom.lp` ending are in the (intermediate) "serialized"
  fact format which closely resembles the COOM language.
- All other files are in the (final) "refined" fact format which is independent
  of COOM
